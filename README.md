# AIML Internship Projects

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of projects completed during my
internship in **Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML)**.
The projects are organized across beginner, intermediate, and advanced
levels, focusing on data analysis, machine learning, and natural
language processing using Python.

Each task demonstrates practical application of AI/ML concepts on
real-world datasets and problem statements.
